# Movie Finder

Hello fellow,
here is the code and you can find the github page here
```bash
https://janainaf.github.io/
```

## Installation

You can either check the page above, or just clone the repo and open index.html to see the webpage.

```bash
git clone and voila you know the drill 
```

### Warning

Search bar is working (with a nice bug - it doesnt refresh so new entries go to the end of the list)
Modal is working fine
So far no lazy loading but hang in there
